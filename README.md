# Background and Description
Samplezon is a eCommerce platform where users can create an account and add sample packs into a shopping cart and 'check out' via Stripe. Users can bump while they shop and feel and hear the power of these sample packs. What are sample packs? A sample pack is a collection of sounds consisting of loops and one-shots that are specially designed for producers to use as building blocks in their songs. Fork this project to release the power of Samplezon and experience the #1 resource for products and artists.
